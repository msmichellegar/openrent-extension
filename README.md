# OpenRent Extension

Have you ever flat-searched in the UK and been extremely annoyed at the inability to sort properties by most recently listed on OpenRent? Be frustrated no more. I made a Chrome extension.

Install this extension, and when you view a listings page on OpenRent, it will automatically scroll down the page to load all results, and then sort the properties starting with the most recently listed. It'll take about 10-15 seconds.

It's just 75 lines of dodgy jQuery. But it does what you want.

## How to Install

Download this repository, then follow [this guide](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2714278?hl=en) to use it in Chome.
